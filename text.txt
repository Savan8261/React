Project Title: Quiz App

Description:

Create a quiz application where users can take quizzes on various topics. The app should have the following features:

Authentication: Users should be able to sign up and log in to the application.

Quiz Categories: Users should be able to choose from different quiz categories (e.g., Science, History, Sports).

Quiz Selection: Once a category is selected, users should be able to choose a specific quiz to take.

Quiz Taking: Users should be presented with a series of questions one at a time. They should be able to select answers and move to the next question.

Scoring: Display the user's score at the end of the quiz, showing how many questions they answered correctly out of the total.

Leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard to display high scores of users for each quiz category.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
Technical Requirements:

Use React.js for building the user interface.

Manage application state using either React's built-in state management or a state management library like Redux.

Implement client-side routing using React Router for navigating between different pages (e.g., login, quiz selection, quiz taking).

Utilize a backend server (built with Node.js, Express, etc.) to handle user authentication, quiz data storage, and leaderboard functionality. You can also use a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) like Firebase for this purpose.

Store quiz questions and answers in a database (e.g., MongoDB) and fetch them dynamically based on the user's selections.

Use CSS (or a CSS preprocessor like Sass) for styling the application, and consider using a UI framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI for faster development.

Bonus Features (Optional):

Allow users to create their own quizzes and share them with others.

Implement a timer for each question to make the quiz more challenging.

Add animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.

Include social sharing functionality so users can share their quiz results on social media platforms.
